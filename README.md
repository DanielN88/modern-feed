<h1> Welcome to the Modern Feed Front-End Application! </h1>
</div>

<br>


# Intro
This application is the front-end repository for [Modern Feed](https://github.com/DanielN88/modern-feed). This repo was a quick eight hour challenge to see what we could build out in the time frame. It was important to stick to our mvp and use organizational resources to ensure all goals were hit. 

# Organizational Resources
This project used a detailed [project board](https://github.com/users/DanielN88/projects/3/views/1) as well as as [wireframe](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOj82Iss=/)

# Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript
- Router
- HTML
- CSS
- Cypress

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Set Up

 1. Start by going [here](https://github.com/DanielN88/modern-feed). From here you will want to click on the green rectangular button titled 'Code'. This should open a drop down menu where you should see a link. To the left of the link there should be an icon with two over lapping squares. You can click the icon to copy the link.
 2. You will want to clone down the repo to you terminal using `git clone git@github.com:PupTrainer/fe_puptrainer.git`.
 3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install project dependencies.
 4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the page. You will need to copy and paste the local server from the terminal and paste it into your browser. The local server should be simialiar to, "http://localhost:3000/". `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server. Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems.
